# Tests

`patrol-rules-github` has both linting and unit tests. You can start the whole test suite via `npm test` which will first execute the eslint tests, then the unit tests. The whole test suite is also run by [Travis CI](https://magnum.travis-ci.org/mapbox/patrol-rules-github).

## Linting

`eslint` is used for linting the JavaScript. Run it separately from the unit test via `npm run lint`.

## Unit tests

Unit tests are done with [tape](https://www.npmjs.org/package/tape). Start them with `npm run unit-test`. The unit tests live in [/test](https://github.com/mapbox/patrol-rules-github/tree/master/test).
